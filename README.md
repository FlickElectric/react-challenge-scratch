## Flick React Developer Challenge

Kia Ora! Flick's React developer challenge is designed to get an idea of the scope of your front end knowledge in the context of a React app and is intended to be undertaken as a pairing exercise with one or two of our developers.

If you finish the challenge, that's great, but is totally fine to only get part of the way through. We want to see your problem solving skills; so explain any decisions you make based on your time / knowledge constraints as you go.

This challenge is also fully open book, which means you're welcome to use google to find whatever you need, reference previous projects you've worked on, ask for help or advice from your pairing partners, or whatever other things you'd normally do to feel comfortable solving a problem during your day to day work.
## Instructions

Clone this repository and create a branch with your name in it.

Your first task is to create the bones of a React app. You can do this however you like whether that means generating it with create-react-app, or working from a personally preferred template, the choice is yours! 

Next, we want you to build a simple admin dashboard that does some or all of the following using the accounts.json file in this project:

- A user can search for accounts based on email address. Possible accounts should display their usage type and address.
- When the user clicks on an account search result, the account information should display
- Search results that have been clicked on are listed in a 'history' section of the browser, so that the user knows what results have been viewed already.

It's up to you how you arrange the information on the screen, but this challenge is specifically looking at your front end skills using React , so we're more interested in how you implement the functional parts of this than what the end product looks like.

Once you're finished write a summary of your code changes, including any decisions or tradeoffs you made. Since a single interview isn't a lot of time, include anything you would have done or changed given more time, then create a pull request in this repo.

Have any questions? Please ask!
